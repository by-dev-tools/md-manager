# Plan

The living document for what's being worked on right now, what's queued, and what to pick up next session. Longer-range work goes in `roadmap.md`. Decision history goes in `history.md`.

## Current Focus

**Mini design system adoption — PR C: Token + component migration.** PR A (install) and PR B (elicit + amend design language) shipped. PR C migrates `src/styles/globals.css` tokens into `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` and migrates components one at a time to Mini primitives + archetypes. Multi-session, iterative — each component is its own small PR with its own staff-review pass.

## Handoff Notes

- **PR C Step 1 (token name-collision audit) shipped on `pr-c-token-audit`** — `a7c6a07` (initial audit) + `6f27e49` (/simplify fixes for `--gray-a*` miss) + this ship commit. Output: `core-docs/token-migration.md` with the 14-token collision table and work lists for Step 3a + Step 3. Repo: `by-dev-tools/md-manager` (migrated from `byamron/md-manager`). FB-0022, FB-0023, FB-0024 captured. No code changed.
- **GitHub Org transfer complete** — `byamron/md-manager` is now `by-dev-tools/md-manager`. Branch protection + Rulesets preserved across transfer. Merge queue is **active** with required checks `typecheck` / `build` / `test`. Dependabot security updates enabled (two security PRs already opened: #12 esbuild+vite, #13 vite major). Secret Protection enabled. All git remotes (worktree config and Conductor workspaces) now use HTTPS.
- **Next two PRs unblock PR C Step 3 (tokens migration):**
  - **PR C Step 3a** — rename `--gray-a5/6/7` → `--tint-overlay-{light,medium,strong}` (or similar; final name decided at PR time). Touches every reference in `globals.css` + 3 component-manifest entries. Mechanical. Should be next.
  - **PR C Step 2** — `--accent-8` contrast matrix against every page-tint hue. Required before any component starts using `var(--accent-9)` for focus rings. Can run in parallel with Step 3a.
- **PR C Step 3 (tokens migration) blocked by both Step 2 and Step 3a.** When unblocked: rebind 4 radius tokens in `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` to our values; move 29 md-manager-only tokens into a project-additions section of `tokens.css`; delete every `--*` declaration from `globals.css`. Plan in `core-docs/token-migration.md` § "PR C Step 3".
- **Surface posture is an open axiom with explicit resolution criteria** (FB-0019, `design-language.md` § "Axioms → Open axiom: surface posture"). Both floating and flat continue to ship in the DevPanel. PR C component migrations must support both postures.
- **Accent identity = `--page-tint`**, not a fixed Mini accent scale (axiom #3). Components using `var(--accent-9)` for focus/links must clear contrast against every page-tint hue (Step 2 above).
- **All components are `status: legacy`** in `core-docs/component-manifest.json`. PR C flips them to `managed` one at a time, each migration its own commit + manifest update.
- **The neutralization block at the bottom of `src/styles/globals.css`** stays until PR C migrates the components that depend on the legacy focus styling.
- **Mini per-generation log updates** are **mechanical contract artifacts** — they update inline with UI changes, not at `/ship` time.
- **Polished-features doctrine is canonical.** CLAUDE.md § "Quality posture" + FB-0007 + FB-0008.
- Persistence, repo sync, and search remain unresolved; see "Open questions" in `spec.md`. These come after Mini adoption settles.
- **Surface posture is an open axiom with explicit resolution criteria** (FB-0019, `design-language.md` § "Axioms → Open axiom: surface posture"). Both floating and flat continue to ship in the DevPanel. PR C component migrations must support both postures — do not assume one. Decision happens via dogfooding signal, an archetype constraint, or an explicit user call.
- **Accent identity = `--page-tint`**, not a fixed Mini accent scale (axiom #3). `indigo` is reserved at the root via `data-accent="indigo"` for focus-ring rebinding but is currently neutralized. PR C components that use `var(--accent-8)` / `var(--accent-9)` (focus rings, links, selected state) must clear ≥3:1 against every page-tint hue the color rail can produce. The contrast matrix is the first PR-C prerequisite (already in roadmap.md under "From PR A staff review").
- **All components are `status: legacy`** in `core-docs/component-manifest.json`. PR C flips them to `managed` one at a time, each migration its own commit + manifest update.
- **The neutralization block at the bottom of `src/styles/globals.css`** (`img/video/svg display`, universal `:focus-visible` ring) stays until PR C migrates the components that depend on the legacy focus styling. Remove the block incrementally as components migrate.
- **Mini per-generation log updates** (component-manifest.json, generation-log.md, pattern-log.md) are **mechanical contract artifacts** — they update inline with UI changes, not at `/ship` time. This is explicit in CLAUDE.md § "Mini Design System" → "Procedure for UI tasks". Narrative docs (history.md, plan.md, roadmap.md, spec.md, feedback.md) remain `/ship`-owned.
- **PR C prerequisites already captured in `roadmap.md`** under "From PR A staff review (Mini install)": token name collision audit (highest-priority), `--accent-8` contrast validation across user page tints, alias scheme reconciliation (single `@mini` vs split), tsconfig include expansion, sync-mini.sh error-handling hardening.
- **Polished-features doctrine is canonical.** CLAUDE.md § "Quality posture" + FB-0007 + FB-0008. Every scoping decision runs through wire-vs-defer.
- Persistence, repo sync, and search remain unresolved; see "Open questions" in `spec.md`. These come after Mini adoption settles.

## Active Work Items

### PR C: Token + component migration (multi-session, iterative — current)

**Goal:** Migrate `src/styles/globals.css` tokens to Mini's `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css`. Migrate components one at a time to Mini primitives + archetypes. Remove duplicate machinery (custom Toast → Mini Toast archetype). Pass the invariant check on `src/`. Flip each component's `status` in `core-docs/component-manifest.json` from `legacy` → `managed` as it migrates.

**Order (rough, sequenced for incremental review):**
1. **Token name-collision audit first** (highest-priority prerequisite from `roadmap.md` "From PR A staff review"). Build the project; grep `dist/assets/*.css` for each duplicated token name; document which value wins. Decide intentional re-bindings explicitly. Output: a token-migration plan that names every collision.
2. **`--accent-8` contrast matrix** against every page-tint hue the color rail produces. Required before the first component uses `var(--accent-9)` for focus rings or links. Output: contrast pass/fail per hue + an axiom amendment if a hue fails.
3. **Tokens migration.** Rewrite `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` (fork-and-own) with our project values; delete duplicated `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--sand-*`, `--type-*` from `globals.css`.
4. **Toast.** Replace `src/components/Toast.tsx` with Mini's Toast archetype, keep our `<ToastProvider>` API surface so callers don't change. Flip manifest entry to `managed`.
5. **Dialogs / popovers.** AttachPopover, AddRepoModal → Mini Popover / Dialog archetypes. Each is its own PR.
6. **Layout primitives.** Sidebar, Editor frame, ColorRail → Mini Box/Stack/Cluster/Sidebar/Container primitives where they fit. Keep contenteditable + FloatingToolbar custom.
7. **Invariant check passes on `src/`** as each component migrates. Final pass: `node tools/invariants/check.mjs src/` clean.

**Constraints carried from PR B:**
- **Both surface postures must continue to work** through PR C. The DevPanel toggle stays. Any archetype migration must support both `mode-floating` and `mode-flat` body classes — do not pick one and remove the other without an explicit user call.
- **`--page-tint` is the accent**, not a fixed Mini accent scale. Components that use `var(--accent-9)` for focus/links must clear contrast against every hue on the color rail.

PR C is **iterative across sessions** — each component migration is its own small PR with its own `/simplify` + `/staff-review` pass.

### PR C / Step 3a: `--gray-a*` rename (current — ½ session)

**Goal:** Rename our `--gray-a5/6/7` page-tint wash overlays to a name that doesn't clash with Mini's Radix-imported `--gray-a*` scale. Mechanical rename across `globals.css` + 2 references in `design-language.md`. Lands before PR C Step 3 (tokens migration) so Step 3's diff stays purely about duplicate-removal + radius rebinding.

**Branch:** `pr-c-gray-a-rename` (off `main` at `6f25c0e`).

**Scope:** CSS rename in `src/styles/globals.css` (3 declarations + 14 usages = 17 line edits) + 2 references in `core-docs/design-language.md`. No TSX changes. No component-manifest changes (the manifest's `tokens_referenced` arrays don't currently list these tokens — verified).

**Token name proposal: `--tint-overlay-{light,medium,strong}`**

| Old | New | Value (unchanged) |
|---|---|---|
| `--gray-a5` | `--tint-overlay-light` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)` |
| `--gray-a6` | `--tint-overlay-medium` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075)` |
| `--gray-a7` | `--tint-overlay-strong` | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.11)` |

**Rationale:** these tokens are alpha-black overlays applied *over* the page tint to create subtle washes (skeleton blocks per design-language § Loading states, code-block backgrounds, hairline borders, dividers). "Tint-overlay" names what they do; "light/medium/strong" describes the opacity progression. Preserves Mini's `--gray-a*` namespace for the full Radix alpha primitive (12-step scale; we don't use it today but could later without a re-rename).

**Alternatives considered:**
- `--page-overlay-*` — also accurate but congests the `--page-*` namespace (`--page-tint`, `--page-text`, `--page-overlay`).
- `--wash-*` — short, but less self-explanatory.
- `--overlay-*` — too generic; Mini may want a true overlay layer token (modal scrims etc.) later.

**Implementation steps:**
1. Rename 3 declarations in `src/styles/globals.css:13-15`.
2. Replace 14 `var(--gray-a*)` usages in `globals.css` (verified locations: lines 440, 485, 531, 580, 640, 651, 662, 674, 725, 742, 788, 852, 1269, 1314). Mechanical search-and-replace.
3. Update `core-docs/design-language.md`:
   - § Color system table (line 123) — token name + the cell-label `--gray-a5 / a6 / a7`
   - § Loading states (line 212) — prose reference to "skeleton blocks in `--gray-a5`"
4. `npm run typecheck && npm run build` clean.
5. Spot-check `dist/assets/*.css`: our 3 declarations now use new names; Mini's Radix-imported `--gray-a1..12` (12-step) still present and untouched.
6. /simplify + /ship through the merge queue.

**Out of scope (for this PR):**
- Token consolidation, radius rebinding, deleting duplicate space/weight declarations — that's PR C Step 3, blocked by this PR + Step 2 (contrast matrix).
- Component-manifest updates — manifest doesn't currently reference these tokens.
- `design-language.md` change-log entry — `/ship` synthesizes that.

**Risks / open questions:**
- **Final token names.** Confirm `--tint-overlay-light/medium/strong` at approval. Other strong contenders: `--wash-{light,medium,strong}`, `--page-overlay-*`.
- **Stale references in core-docs/** (`history.md`, `token-migration.md`) refer to `--gray-a*` as historical state. **Do not update those** — they describe the state at writing time; updating them rewrites history.
- **Visual change risk: zero.** Values are unchanged. Bundle output is byte-identical for all selectors using these tokens, only with different token names in the declarations.

### PR C / Step 2: `--accent-8` contrast matrix (parallel to Step 3a, blocks Step 4+)

**Goal:** Verify that `var(--accent-8)` (Radix indigo-8 = `#8da4ef`) clears ≥3:1 contrast against every page-tint hue the color rail produces. Required before any component starts using `var(--accent-8)` or `var(--accent-9)` for focus rings, links, or selected state. Output: a contrast pass/fail table per hue + an axiom amendment if any hue fails.

**Branch:** `pr-c-accent-contrast` (off `main`).

**Scope: docs-only.** No code changes. Output is an entry in `core-docs/token-migration.md` (or its own doc — decide at plan time).

**Implementation steps:**
- [ ] Enumerate the color-rail hue space (the HSL gradient + the 8 preset swatches) from `src/components/ColorRail.tsx`.
- [ ] For each hue, compute the contrast ratio between `--accent-8` (indigo-8) and the corresponding `--page-tint` value.
- [ ] Flag any hue where contrast < 3:1 (WCAG AA for UI components).
- [ ] If any fail: propose a fix. Options include (a) using `--accent-9` instead, (b) re-binding accent to a different scale for that hue range, (c) adding axiom #10 (focus style) amendment that names the workaround.
- [ ] Update `core-docs/token-migration.md` (or new doc) with the matrix + decision.

**Risks / open questions:**
- **HSL gradient is continuous, not a finite set.** Sampling decision: test the 8 presets + a 16-step sweep of the gradient (24 total). Confirm at plan time.
- **Indigo-8 may fail on dark page tints.** If so, the resolution affects axiom #10 (focus style) and may force a change to the design-language `--accent-8`-reservation language.
