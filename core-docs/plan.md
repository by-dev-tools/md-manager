# Plan

The living document for what's being worked on right now, what's queued, and what to pick up next session. Longer-range work goes in `roadmap.md`. Decision history goes in `history.md`.

## Current Focus

**Mini design system adoption — PR C: Token + component migration.** PR A (install) and PR B (elicit + amend design language) shipped. PR C migrates `src/styles/globals.css` tokens into `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` and migrates components one at a time to Mini primitives + archetypes. Multi-session, iterative — each component is its own small PR with its own staff-review pass.

## Handoff Notes

- **PR B (Mini design-language amendment) shipped on `mini-elicit`** — `97ff141` (axioms + manifest + logs + CLAUDE.md) + `87869d7` (/simplify fixes) + this ship commit. PR pending push. `/simplify` ran 3 MUST FIX + 1 NIT; staff/security/a11y reviews skipped per their docs-only rules. No code changed; visible UI byte-identical to `main`.
- **Surface posture is an open axiom with explicit resolution criteria** (FB-0019, `design-language.md` § "Axioms → Open axiom: surface posture"). Both floating and flat continue to ship in the DevPanel. PR C component migrations must support both postures — do not assume one. Decision happens via dogfooding signal, an archetype constraint, or an explicit user call.
- **Accent identity = `--page-tint`**, not a fixed Mini accent scale (axiom #3). `indigo` is reserved at the root via `data-accent="indigo"` for focus-ring rebinding but is currently neutralized. PR C components that use `var(--accent-8)` / `var(--accent-9)` (focus rings, links, selected state) must clear ≥3:1 against every page-tint hue the color rail can produce. The contrast matrix is the first PR-C prerequisite (already in roadmap.md under "From PR A staff review").
- **All components are `status: legacy`** in `core-docs/component-manifest.json`. PR C flips them to `managed` one at a time, each migration its own commit + manifest update.
- **The neutralization block at the bottom of `src/styles/globals.css`** (`img/video/svg display`, universal `:focus-visible` ring) stays until PR C migrates the components that depend on the legacy focus styling. Remove the block incrementally as components migrate.
- **Mini per-generation log updates** (component-manifest.json, generation-log.md, pattern-log.md) are **mechanical contract artifacts** — they update inline with UI changes, not at `/ship` time. This is explicit in CLAUDE.md § "Mini Design System" → "Procedure for UI tasks". Narrative docs (history.md, plan.md, roadmap.md, spec.md, feedback.md) remain `/ship`-owned.
- **PR C prerequisites already captured in `roadmap.md`** under "From PR A staff review (Mini install)": token name collision audit (highest-priority), `--accent-8` contrast validation across user page tints, alias scheme reconciliation (single `@mini` vs split), tsconfig include expansion, sync-mini.sh error-handling hardening.
- **Polished-features doctrine is canonical.** CLAUDE.md § "Quality posture" + FB-0007 + FB-0008. Every scoping decision runs through wire-vs-defer.
- Persistence, repo sync, and search remain unresolved; see "Open questions" in `spec.md`. These come after Mini adoption settles.

## Active Work Items

### PR C: Token + component migration (multi-session, iterative — current)

**Goal:** Migrate `src/styles/globals.css` tokens to Mini's `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css`. Migrate components one at a time to Mini primitives + archetypes. Remove duplicate machinery (custom Toast → Mini Toast archetype). Pass the invariant check on `src/`. Flip each component's `status` in `core-docs/component-manifest.json` from `legacy` → `managed` as it migrates.

**Order (rough, sequenced for incremental review):**
1. **Token name-collision audit first** (highest-priority prerequisite from `roadmap.md` "From PR A staff review"). Build the project; grep `dist/assets/*.css` for each duplicated token name; document which value wins. Decide intentional re-bindings explicitly. Output: a token-migration plan that names every collision.
2. **`--accent-8` contrast matrix** against every page-tint hue the color rail produces. Required before the first component uses `var(--accent-9)` for focus rings or links. Output: contrast pass/fail per hue + an axiom amendment if a hue fails.
3. **Tokens migration.** Rewrite `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` (fork-and-own) with our project values; delete duplicated `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--sand-*`, `--type-*` from `globals.css`.
4. **Toast.** Replace `src/components/Toast.tsx` with Mini's Toast archetype, keep our `<ToastProvider>` API surface so callers don't change. Flip manifest entry to `managed`.
5. **Dialogs / popovers.** AttachPopover, AddRepoModal → Mini Popover / Dialog archetypes. Each is its own PR.
6. **Layout primitives.** Sidebar, Editor frame, ColorRail → Mini Box/Stack/Cluster/Sidebar/Container primitives where they fit. Keep contenteditable + FloatingToolbar custom.
7. **Invariant check passes on `src/`** as each component migrates. Final pass: `node tools/invariants/check.mjs src/` clean.

**Constraints carried from PR B:**
- **Both surface postures must continue to work** through PR C. The DevPanel toggle stays. Any archetype migration must support both `mode-floating` and `mode-flat` body classes — do not pick one and remove the other without an explicit user call.
- **`--page-tint` is the accent**, not a fixed Mini accent scale. Components that use `var(--accent-9)` for focus/links must clear contrast against every hue on the color rail.

PR C is **iterative across sessions** — each component migration is its own small PR with its own `/simplify` + `/staff-review` pass.

## Recently Completed

_(Last 3–5 items. Older items live in `history.md`.)_

- **Mini design language amended (PR B)** — Branch `mini-elicit`, commits `97ff141..[ship]`. Explicit Axioms section answers all 10 Mini axioms; surface-posture flagged as an open axiom (both floating and flat ship for dogfooding). Component manifest, pattern-log, generation-log seeded. CLAUDE.md Mini section appended. FB-0018, FB-0019 captured. No code changed. 2026-05-14.
- **Mini design system installed (PR A)** — Branch `mini-install`, commits `0d17846..[ship]`. Primitives, archetypes, stylesheets, 6 skills, invariants, templates landed in `packages/ui/` at SHA `83df0b2` (Designer parity). 12 Radix peer deps installed. Stylesheets wired in `main.tsx`; HTML root `class="light-theme" data-accent="indigo"`. No app component migrated. SAFETY: `scripts/sync-mini.sh` snapshots+restores project skills around Mini's destructive `rsync --delete`. FB-0016, FB-0017 captured. 2026-05-14.

Quick captures that haven't been promoted to roadmap.md yet. Promote when an idea sharpens or gets picked up.

- Decide on persistence model (localStorage / IndexedDB / FSA API)
- Decide on repo-sync model (local FS watcher vs GitHub API vs both)
- Search across drafts and repo files
- Dark mode (or explicit decision to skip for v1)
